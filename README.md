# Probabalistic_RL
This work focuses on creating a probabilistic model of reinforcement learning by framing it as inference:
this file will hopefully contain:
1. A policy gradients implementation (PG)
1. A maximum entropy policy gradients implementation (MEPG)
3. PG with generalized advantage estimation (GAE)
4. Soft Actor Critic (SAC) 
5. Off policy Reinforcement learning with prioritized experience replay
4. Proximal Policy Optimization 
5. A2C (multi-proccess actor critic)
6. IMPALA (importance weighted multi-proccess actor critic)
7. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
8. Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients DDPG
9. Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)
